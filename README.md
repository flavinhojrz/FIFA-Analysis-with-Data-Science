## Project Overview
This project analyzes the characteristics of players included in FIFA 24, such as their positions, overall rating, potential, and more. Several functions are implemented to filter players based on different attributes, and the analysis is accompanied by visualizations that provide insights into the distribution of players across different positions and nationalities.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is called `male_players.csv` and includes various attributes of players from FIFA 24, such as:
- `short_name`: Player's name.
- `overall`: Player's overall rating.
- `potential`: Player's potential rating.
- `player_positions`: The positions a player can play in.
- `nationality_name`: Player's nationality.
- `club_name`: Club the player belongs to.
- `value_eur`: Player's market value in euros.
